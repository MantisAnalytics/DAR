#     **QUERY WRITING GUIDELINES:**
#     - Always structure queries with CTEs that first generate AI results, then analyze them
#     - Include statistical validation of AI outputs (distributions, correlations, ranges)
#     - Use appropriate aggregation functions: COUNT(), AVG(), STDDEV(), CORR(), APPROX_QUANTILES()
#     - Add business logic to validate AI results against existing metrics
#     - Include LIMIT clauses for cost control (default: 100-1000 rows)
#     - Filter invalid AI responses and handle edge cases
#     - Provide clear comments explaining the validation logic
#     - Use CASE statements to categorize and validate AI outputs
#
#     **VALIDATION PATTERNS TO INCLUDE:**
#     - Range validation for numeric AI outputs
#     - Category validation for classification results
#     - Correlation analysis with existing business metrics
#     - Distribution analysis of AI results
#     - Quality assessment of generated content
#     - Business rule validation of AI predictions
#
#     **OUTPUT:**
#     Generate complete SQL queries that combine AI functions with immediate statistical analysis. Each query should produce actionable insights that validate the AI outputs through traditional statistical methods.
#     Only return queries, don't run this queries.

    (Other patterns — content generation, churn prediction — follow the same template: first CTE with AI, second with statistical validation.)

    **QUERY WRITING GUIDELINES:**
    - Always use CTEs: AI results first, validation second.
    - Validate AI output with: range checks, category validation, correlations, distribution checks, regex keyword checks.
    - Include LIMITs (100–1000 rows) for cost control.
    - Use CASE for business rules and validations.
    - Use CAST for numeric conversions when AI.GENERATE_INT / DOUBLE is unavailable.

    **OUTPUT:**
    Generate complete BigQuery SQL queries that combine AI functions with immediate statistical analysis. Each query must yield actionable insights that validate AI outputs.
